# EZCompile-PHP
## The EZ way to compile and install PHP on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Status: pre-release, installs PHP CLI (latest-7.1-latest-master[including 8.0-betaX] Version, MacOS ONLY) and can setup a docker application for PHP-7.4.9, Apache-2.4.38, and MySQL-8.0.21 combined) HEAVY DEVELOPMENT
Install Guide Coming Soon

# PLEASE NOTE:
### 1. Some PHP extensions may not be installed in all versions of the PHP CLI due to incompatibility or build errors. The PHP extensions that were removed from PHP 8 downwards are the following:
  * latest-7.4: ***enchant***
  * latest-7.3: ***enchant, iconv, TIDY***
  * latest-7.2: ***enchant, iconv, TIDY, GD, webp support, jpeg support, freetype, zip read/write support***
  * latest-7.1: ***enchant, iconv, TIDY, Argon2 Password Hashing, GD, webp support, jpeg support, freetype, sodium, zip read/write support***
  
### 2. Due to the increased complexity and massively increased user input required to the point where you might as well compile it yourself on Windows, support for this operating system has been temporarily removed from this project's roadmap (and possibly permanently) until further notice.
